ðŸŒ±I'm Elisa Tsai. I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. I am advised by Professor [Atul Prakash](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/). Before Michigan, I received my B.E in Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)). 

My research focuses on building pragmatic, GenAI-powered systems for web security. I also
design algorithms for data efficiency and inference efficiency for vision and large language
models.

Outside of work, I write [blogs](https://etsai.site/) (primarily in Chinese) and [sing](https://soundcloud.com/dumblelisa) occasionally, and once every few years I [draw stuff](https://etsai.site/tags/comics/).
