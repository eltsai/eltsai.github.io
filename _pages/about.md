ðŸŒ±I'm Elisa Tsai. I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. I am advised by Professor [Atul Prakash](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/). Before umich, I received my B.E in Computer Science at the University of Science and Technology of China ([USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)). 

My research focuses on building pragmatic, GenAI-powered systems for web security. I also design algorithms for efficient, high-quality training data selection for vision and large language models. Outside of work, I write [blogs](https://etsai.site/) (primarily in Chinese) and [play ukulele](https://soundcloud.com/elisastayshere) occasionally, and once every few years I [draw stuff](https://etsai.site/tags/comics/).
