üå±I'm Elisa Tsai. I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Atul Prakash](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/).

My research focuses on building pragmatic machine learning systems for security. I also design algorithms for data efficiency and inference efficiency for vision and large language models.

Outside of work, I occasionally record music ([Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/dumblelisa), [ÁΩëÊòì‰∫ë](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=12158117)), and from time to time, I [draw stuff](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/McXhW2YoCneXAPumCUx5qg).

My Chinese name is ÊñáÈü¨ (w√©n tƒÅo), which comes from the Chinese idiom ÊñáÈü¨Ê≠¶Áï• (w√©n tƒÅo w«î l√º√®), meaning good at writing and good at fighting üí™üòÅ
